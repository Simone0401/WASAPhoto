    **WaSAPhoto - Share Special Moments with Friends**

    **Project Overview:** \
    WaSAPhoto is a social media application designed to keep you connected with your friends and loved ones by enabling you to share special moments through photos. With WaSAPhoto, you can seamlessly upload photos directly from your PC and make them visible to everyone who follows you. 

    **Functional Design Specifications:**

    1. **Photo Stream:**
       - Each user is presented with a dynamic stream of photos in reverse chronological order.
       - The stream provides essential information, including the date and time of each photo's upload, and the number of likes and comments it has received.
       - The photo stream is curated with images from users you are "following."

    2. **Interactions:**
       - Users can like photos uploaded by other users and remove their likes at any time.
       - Commenting on photos is encouraged, and users can add comments to any image, even if they uploaded it themselves. Only the authors have the authority to remove their comments.

    3. **User Control:**
       - Users have the ability to ban other users. When a user is banned, they won't have access to any information about the user who banned them. However, the user who initiated the ban can choose to remove it at any time.

    4. **User Profiles:**
       - Each user has a personal profile page, displaying their photos in reverse chronological order.
       - Users can see how many photos they've uploaded and the number of followers and following users.
    
    5. **User Actions:**
       - Users have the freedom to change their usernames, upload photos, remove photos, and follow/unfollow other users.
       - The removal of an image will also result in the removal of associated likes and comments.

    6. **User Search:**
       - A search functionality allows users to discover other user profiles by their usernames.

    7. **Simplified Login:**
       - Users can quickly log in by specifying their username, simplifying the authentication process.

    **Technical Details:**

    The WaSAPhoto app backend REST API is responsible for handling all the interactions and data management to ensure a seamless experience for users. Whether you're sharing your cherished moments or engaging with others' content, the API's functionality is designed to provide a smooth, intuitive, and secure platform for all your photo-sharing needs.

    Join WaSAPhoto and start sharing your special moments today!
